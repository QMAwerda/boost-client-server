                                                    Chapter 1
In that stage of program we made the SimpleExample.cpp, that uses asio for send the GET query on the ip that we need.
    [We can get the domain name with the command 'host wikipedia.org', and ip with 'nslookup 198.35.26.96' in terminal]  
We can put 2 ip addresses for example in our tcp endpoint (comments);

If we will test it with the first IP, all is correct. We get all data that we need, cause our page sending everything in one go
But when we use second IP(51.83...), we see the problems with out sync approach. 
Sync approach:
    1. Send request to get the data
    2. Wait until server send data to us
    3. Take all sent bytes and show it
It's pretty simple, but we have problems in second IP:
(1) We don't know how much data server will send to us. Maybe it's one message like in the first IP, and we will get all data 
in one go, maybe not, and server will send us X amount of bytes Y times; We don't know
(2) We don't know how long server will reply us to our request. And we can't wait too long, cause we need to give work for our 
recourses. We can't have idle recourses, it's can make our program slowly.
